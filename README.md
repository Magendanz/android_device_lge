# android_device_lge
Device configuration for building TWRP on Rockchip reference boards 

## Build notes:
- To get started with OMNI sources to build TWRP, check out the minimal manifest repo [here](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_omni).
- To save space, a shallow clone is recommended.
- These device configurations should be built with the **twrp-5.1** branch.
- Copy this project to /device/lge/ directory.

I built this from the [official TWRP project for the V500](https://github.com/TeamWin/android_device_lge_v500), but used the kernel from the VK810 TWRP v2.8.7.0 build available [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g-pad-83/orig-development/recovery-twrp-2-8-7-0-t3150812).
